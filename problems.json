In addition, you are given a 2D integer array `positions` also of length `n`, where `positions[i] = [ri, ci]` indicates that the `ith` piece is currently at the **1-based** coordinate `(ri, ci)` on the chessboard.\n\n\nWhen making a **move** for a piece, you choose a **destination** square that the piece will travel toward and stop on.\n\n\n* A rook can only travel **horizontally or vertically** from `(r, c)` to the direction of `(r+1, c)`, `(r-1, c)`, `(r, c+1)`, or `(r, c-1)`.\n* A queen can only travel **horizontally, vertically, or diagonally** from `(r, c)` to the direction of `(r+1, c)`, `(r-1, c)`, `(r, c+1)`, `(r, c-1)`, `(r+1, c+1)`, `(r+1, c-1)`, `(r-1, c+1)`, `(r-1, c-1)`.\n* A bishop can only travel **diagonally** from `(r, c)` to the direction of `(r+1, c+1)`, `(r+1, c-1)`, `(r-1, c+1)`, `(r-1, c-1)`.\n\n\nYou must make a **move** for every piece on the board simultaneously. A **move combination** consists of all the **moves** performed on all the given pieces. Every second, each piece will instantaneously travel **one square** towards their destination if they are not already at it. All pieces start traveling at the `0th` second.

    "Content": "Due to a bug, there are many duplicate folders in a file system. You are given a 2D array `paths`, where `paths[i]` is an array representing an absolute path to the `ith` folder in the file system.\n\n\n* For example, `[\"one\", \"two\", \"three\"]` represents the path `\"/one/two/three\"`.\n\n\nTwo folders (not necessarily on the same level) are **identical** if they contain the **same non-empty** set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder structure. The folders **do not** need to be at the root level to be identical. If two or more folders are **identical**, then **mark** the folders as well as all their subfolders.\n\n\n* For example, folders `\"/a\"` and `\"/b\"` in the file structure below are identical. They (as well as their subfolders) should **all** be marked:\n\t+ `/a`\n\t+ `/a/x`\n\t+ `/a/x/y`\n\t+ `/a/z`\n\t+ `/b`\n\t+ `/b/x`\n\t+ `/b/x/y`\n\t+ `/b/z`\n* However, if the file structure also included the path `\"/b/w\"`, then the folders `\"/a\"` and `\"/b\"` would not be identical. Note that `\"/a/x\"` and `\"/b/x\"` would still be considered identical even with the added folder.\n\n\nOnce all the identical folders and their subfolders have been marked, the file system will **delete** all of them. The file system only runs the deletion once, so any folders that become identical after the initial deletion are not deleted.\n\n\nReturn *the 2D array* `ans` *containing the paths of the **remaining** folders after deleting all the marked folders.

Every once in a while, someone in the family dies or a child is born.\n\n\nThe kingdom has a well-defined order of inheritance that consists of the king as the first member. Let's define the recursive function `Successor(x, curOrder)`, which given a person `x` and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after `x` in the order of inheritance.\n\n\n\n```\n\nSuccessor(x, curOrder):\n    if x has no children or all of x's children are in curOrder:\n        if x is the king return null\n        else return Successor(x's parent, curOrder)\n    else return x's oldest child who's not in curOrder\n\n```\n\nFor example, assume we have a kingdom that consists of the king, his children Alice and Bob (Alice is older than Bob), and finally Alice's son Jack.\n\n\n1.

    "Content": "[Run-length encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding) is a string compression method that works by\u00a0replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string\u00a0`\"aabccc\"`\u00a0we replace `\"aa\"`\u00a0by\u00a0`\"a2\"`\u00a0and replace `\"ccc\"`\u00a0by\u00a0`\"c3\"`. Thus the compressed string becomes `\"a2bc3\"`.\n\n\nNotice that in this problem, we are not adding\u00a0`'1'`\u00a0after single characters.\n\n\nGiven a\u00a0string `s`\u00a0and an integer `k`. You need to delete **at most**\u00a0`k` characters from\u00a0`s`\u00a0such that the run-length encoded version of `s`\u00a0has minimum length.\n\n\nFind the *minimum length of the run-length encoded\u00a0version of* `s` *after deleting at most* `k` *characters*.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** s = \"aaabcccd\", k = 2\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** Compressing s without deleting anything will give us \"a3bc3d\" of length 6. Deleting any of the characters 'a' or 'c' would at most decrease the length of the compressed string to 5, for instance delete 2 'a' then we will have s = \"abcccd\" which compressed is abc3d. Therefore, the optimal way is to delete 'b' and 'd', then the compressed version of s will be \"a3c3\" of length 4.\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** s = \"aabbaa\", k = 2\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** If we delete both 'b' characters, the resulting compressed string would be \"a4\" of length 2.\n\n```\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** s = \"aaaaaaaaaaa\", k = 0\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** Since k is zero, we cannot delete anything.

If there are still movements to play return `\"Pending\"`.\n\n\nYou can assume that `moves` is valid (i.e., it follows the rules of **Tic-Tac-Toe**), the grid is initially empty, and `A` will play first.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/22/xo1-grid.jpg)\n\n```\n\n**Input:** moves = [[0,0],[2,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]]\n**Output:** \"A\"\n**Explanation:** A wins, they always play first.\n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/22/xo2-grid.jpg)\n\n```\n\n**Input:** moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]]\n**Output:** \"B\"\n**Explanation:** B wins.\n\n```\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n\n![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/22/xo3-grid.jpg)\n\n```\n\n**Input:** moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[0,1],[0,2],[2,2]]\n**Output:** \"Draw\"\n**Explanation:** The game ends in a draw since there are no moves to make.\n\n```\n\n**Example 4:**\n\n\n![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/22/xo4-grid.jpg)\n\n```\n\n**Input:** moves = [[0,0],[1,1]]\n**Output:** \"Pending\"\n**Explanation:** The game has not finished yet.\n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `1 <= moves.length <= 9`\n* `moves[i].length == 2`\n* `0 <= rowi, coli <= 2`\n* There are no repeated elements on `moves`.\n* `moves` follow the rules of tic tac toe.\n\n\n",

    "Content": "Design a **Skiplist** without using any built-in libraries.\n\n\nA **skiplist** is a data structure that takes `O(log(n))` time to add, erase and search. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists is just simple linked lists.\n\n\nFor example, we have a Skiplist containing `[30,40,50,60,70,90]` and we want to add `80` and `45` into it. The Skiplist works this way:\n\n\n![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/27/1506_skiplist.gif)  \n\nArtyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Skip_list_add_element-en.gif \"Artyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)], via Wikimedia Commons\")\n\n\nYou can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than `O(n)`. It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is `O(log(n))` and space complexity is `O(n)`.\n\n\nSee more about Skiplist: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list>\n\n\nImplement the `Skiplist` class:\n\n\n* `Skiplist()` Initializes the object of the skiplist.\n* `bool search(int target)` Returns `true` if the integer `target` exists in the Skiplist or `false` otherwise.\n* `void add(int num)` Inserts the value `num` into the SkipList.\n* `bool erase(int num)` Removes the value `num` from the Skiplist and returns `true`. If `num` does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return `false`. If there exist multiple `num` values, removing any one of them is fine.\n\n\nNote that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input**\n[\"Skiplist\", \"add\", \"add\", \"add\", \"search\", \"add\", \"search\", \"erase\", \"erase\", \"search\"]\n[[], [1], [2], [3], [0], [4], [1], [0], [1], [1]]\n**Output**\n[null, null, null, null, false, null, true, false, true, false]\n**Explanation**\nSkiplist skiplist = new Skiplist();\nskiplist.add(1);\nskiplist.add(2);\nskiplist.add(3);\nskiplist.search(0); // return False\nskiplist.add(4);\nskiplist.search(1); // return True\nskiplist.erase(0);  // return False, 0 is not in skiplist.\nskiplist.erase(1);  // return True\nskiplist.search(1); // return False, 1 has already been erased.\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `0 <= num, target <= 2 * 104`\n* At most `5 * 104` calls will be made to `search`, `add`, and `erase`.\n\n\n",

In each move, starting from square `curr`, do the following:\n\n\n* Choose a destination square `next` with a label in the range `[curr + 1, min(curr + 6, n2)]`.\n\t+ This choice simulates the result of a standard **6-sided die roll**: i.e., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.\n* If `next` has a snake or ladder, you **must** move to the destination of that snake or ladder. Otherwise, you move to `next`.\n* The game ends when you reach the square `n2`.\n\n\nA board square on row `r` and column `c` has a snake or ladder if `board[r][c] != -1`. The destination of that snake or ladder is `board[r][c]`. Squares `1` and `n2` do not have a snake or ladder.\n\n\nNote that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move. If the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do **not** follow the subsequent\u00a0snake or ladder.\n\n\n* For example, suppose the board is `[[-1,4],[-1,3]]`, and on the first move, your destination square is `2`. You follow the ladder to square `3`, but do **not** follow the subsequent ladder to `4`.\n\n\nReturn *the least number of moves required to reach the square* `n2`*.

    "Content": "You are given a string expression representing a Lisp-like expression to return the integer value of.\n\n\nThe syntax for these expressions is given as follows.\n\n\n* An expression is either an integer, let expression, add expression, mult expression, or an assigned variable. Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.\n* (An integer could be positive or negative.)\n* A let expression takes the form `\"(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr)\"`, where let is always the string `\"let\"`, then there are one or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable `v1` is assigned the value of the expression `e1`, the second variable `v2` is assigned the value of the expression `e2`, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let expression is the value of the expression `expr`.\n* An add expression takes the form `\"(add e1 e2)\"` where add is always the string `\"add\"`, there are always two expressions `e1`, `e2` and the result is the addition of the evaluation of `e1` and the evaluation of `e2`.\n* A mult expression takes the form `\"(mult e1 e2)\"` where mult is always the string `\"mult\"`, there are always two expressions `e1`, `e2` and the result is the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.\n* For this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally, for your convenience, the names `\"add\"`, `\"let\"`, and `\"mult\"` are protected and will never be used as variable names.\n* Finally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially. It is guaranteed that every expression is legal. Please see the examples for more details on the scope.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** expression = \"(let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y))))\"\n**Output:** 14\n**Explanation:** In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x,\nwe check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate.\nSince x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.\n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** expression = \"(let x 3 x 2 x)\"\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.\n\n```\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** expression = \"(let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y))\"\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x.\nThe second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.\n\n```\n\n**Example 4:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** expression = \"(let x 2 (add (let x 3 (let x 4 x)) x))\"\n**Output:** 6\n**Explanation:** Even though (let x 4 x) has a deeper scope, it is outside the context\nof the final x in the add-expression.  That final x will equal 2.\n\n```\n\n**Example 5:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** expression = \"(let a1 3 b2 (add a1 1) b2)\"\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** Variable names can contain digits after the first character.\n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `1 <= expression.length <= 2000`\n* There are no leading or trailing spaces in `exprssion`.\n* All tokens are separated by a single space in `expressoin`.\n* The answer and all intermediate calculations of that answer are guaranteed to fit in a **32-bit** integer.\n* The expression is guaranteed to be legal and evaluate to an integer.\n\n\n",

    "Content": "Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array of strings `source` where `source[i]` is the `ith` line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character `'\\n'`.\n\n\nIn C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.\n\n\n* The string `\"//\"` denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.\n* The string `\"/*\"` denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of `\"*/\"` should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string `\"/*/\"` does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.\n\n\nThe first effective comment takes precedence over others.\n\n\n* For example, if the string `\"//\"` occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.\n* Similarly, if the string `\"/*\"` occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.\n\n\nIf a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.\n\n\nThere will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.\n\n\n* For example, `source = \"string s = \"/* Not a comment. */\";\"` will not be a test case.\n\n\nAlso, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so `\"/*\"` outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.\n\n\nFinally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details.\n\n\nAfter removing the comments from the source code, return *the source code in the same format*.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** source = [\"/*Test program */\", \"int main()\", \"{ \", \"  // variable declaration \", \"int a, b, c;\", \"/* This is a test\", \"   multiline  \", \"   comment for \", \"   testing */\", \"a = b + c;\", \"}\"]\n**Output:** [\"int main()\",\"{ \",\"  \",\"int a, b, c;\",\"a = b + c;\",\"}\"]\n**Explanation:** The line by line code is visualized as below:\n/*Test program */\nint main()\n{ \n  // variable declaration \nint a, b, c;\n/* This is a test\n   multiline  \n   comment for \n   testing */\na = b + c;\n}\nThe string /* denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string // denotes line 4 as comments.\nThe line by line output code is visualized as below:\nint main()\n{ \n  \nint a, b, c;\na = b + c;\n}\n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** source = [\"a/*comment\", \"line\", \"more\\_comment*/b\"]\n**Output:** [\"ab\"]\n**Explanation:** The original source string is \"a/*comment\\nline\\nmore\\_comment*/b\", where we have bolded the newline characters.  After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string \"ab\", which when delimited by newline characters becomes [\"ab\"].\n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `1 <= source.length <= 100`\n* `0 <= source[i].length <= 80`\n* `source[i]` consists of printable **ASCII** characters.\n* Every open block comment is eventually closed.\n* There are no single-quote or\u00a0double-quote in the input.\n\n\n",

An integer `x` - Record a new score of `x`.\n2. `\"+\"` - Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores. It is guaranteed there will always be two previous scores.\n3. `\"D\"` - Record a new score that is double the previous score. It is guaranteed there will always be a previous score.\n4. `\"C\"` - Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record. It is guaranteed there will always be a previous score.\n\n\nReturn *the sum of all the scores on the record*.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** ops = [\"5\",\"2\",\"C\",\"D\",\"+\"]\n**Output:** 30\n**Explanation:**\n\"5\" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].\n\"2\" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2].\n\"C\" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5].\n\"D\" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10].\n\"+\" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record, record is now [5, 10, 15].\nThe total sum is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30.\n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** ops = [\"5\",\"-2\",\"4\",\"C\",\"D\",\"9\",\"+\",\"+\"]\n**Output:** 27\n**Explanation:**\n\"5\" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].\n\"-2\" - Add -2 to the record, record is now [5, -2].\n\"4\" - Add 4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, 4].\n\"C\" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5, -2].\n\"D\" - Add 2 * -2 = -4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4].\n\"9\" - Add 9 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9].\n\"+\" - Add -4 + 9 = 5 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5].\n\"+\" - Add 9 + 5 = 14 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5, 14].\nThe total sum is 5 + -2 + -4 + 9 + 5 + 14 = 27.\n\n```\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** ops = [\"1\"]\n**Output:** 1\n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `1 <= ops.length <= 1000`\n* `ops[i]` is `\"C\"`, `\"D\"`, `\"+\"`, or a string representing an integer in the range `[-3 * 104, 3 * 104]`.\n* For operation `\"+\"`, there will always be at least two previous scores on the record.\n* For operations `\"C\"` and `\"D\"`, there will always be at least one previous score on the record.\n\n\n",

The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse `CDATA_CONTENT`, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as **regular characters**.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** code = \"<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>\"\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:** \nThe code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. \nThe TAG\\_NAME is valid, the TAG\\_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. \nAlthough CDATA\\_CONTENT has an unmatched start tag with invalid TAG\\_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as a tag.\nSo TAG\\_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.\n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** code = \"<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>\"\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:**\nWe first separate the code into : start\\_tag|tag\\_content|end\\_tag.\nstart\\_tag -> **\"<DIV>\"**\nend\\_tag -> **\"</DIV>\"**\ntag\\_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.\ntext1 -> **\">> ![cdata[]] \"**\ncdata -> **\"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>\"**, where the CDATA\\_CONTENT is **\"<div>]>\"**\ntext2 -> **\"]]>>]\"**\nThe reason why start\\_tag is NOT **\"<DIV>>>\"** is because of the rule 6.\nThe reason why cdata is NOT **\"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>\"** is because of the rule 7.\n\n```\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** code = \"<A>  <B> </A>   </B>\"\n**Output:** false\n**Explanation:** Unbalanced. If \"<A>\" is closed, then \"<B>\" must be unmatched, and vice versa.\n\n```\n\n**Example 4:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** code = \"<DIV>  div tag is not closed  <DIV>\"\n**Output:** false\n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `1 <= code.length <= 500`\n* `code` consists of English letters, digits, `'<'`, `'>'`, `'/'`, `'!'`, `'['`, `']'`, `'.'`, and `' '`.\n\n\n",

Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most `k` distinct projects.\n\n\nYou are given `n` projects where the `ith` project has a pure profit `profits[i]` and a minimum capital of `capital[i]` is needed to start it.\n\n\nInitially, you have `w` capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.\n\n\nPick a list of **at most** `k` distinct projects from given projects to **maximize your final capital**, and return *the final maximized capital*.\n\n\nThe answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:** Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.\nAfter finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.\nWith capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.\nSince you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.\nTherefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** k = 3, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,2]\n**Output:** 6\n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `1 <= k <= 105`\n* `0 <= w <= 109`\n* `n == profits.length`\n* `n == capital.length`\n* `1 <= n <= 105`\n* `0 <= profits[i] <= 104`\n* `0 <= capital[i] <= 109`\n\n\n",

    "Content": "Given a `n * n` matrix `grid` of `0's` and `1's` only. We want to represent the `grid` with a Quad-Tree.\n\n\nReturn *the root of the Quad-Tree* representing the `grid`.\n\n\nNotice that you can assign the value of a node to **True** or **False** when `isLeaf` is **False**, and both are **accepted** in the answer.\n\n\nA Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:\n\n\n* `val`: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.\n* `isLeaf`: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.\n\n\n\n```\n\r\nclass Node {\r\n    public boolean val;\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 public boolean isLeaf;\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 public Node topLeft;\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 public Node topRight;\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 public Node bottomLeft;\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 public Node bottomRight;\r\n}\n```\n\nWe can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:\n\n\n1. If the current grid has the same value (i.e all `1's` or all `0's`)\u00a0set `isLeaf`\u00a0True and set `val` to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.\n2. If the current grid has different values, set `isLeaf` to False and\u00a0set `val` to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.\n3. Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.\n\n\n![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/11/new_top.png)\nIf you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the\u00a0[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree).\n\n\n**Quad-Tree\u00a0format:**\n\n\nThe output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where `null` signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.\n\n\nIt is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list `[isLeaf, val]`.\n\n\nIf the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is True we represent it as **1** in the list\u00a0`[isLeaf, val]` and if the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is False we represent it as **0**.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/11/grid1.png)\n\n```\n\n**Input:** grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]\n**Output:** [[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]\n**Explanation:** The explanation of this example is shown below:\nNotice that 0 represnts False and 1 represents True in the photo representing the Quad-Tree.\n![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/12/e1tree.png)\n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/12/e2mat.png)\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** grid = [[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]]\n**Output:** [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]\n**Explanation:** All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids.\nThe topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value.\nThe topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.\nExplanation is shown in the photo below:\n![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/12/e2tree.png)\n\n```\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** grid = [[1,1],[1,1]]\n**Output:** [[1,1]]\n\n```\n\n**Example 4:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** grid = [[0]]\n**Output:** [[1,0]]\n\n```\n\n**Example 5:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** grid = [[1,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,1],[0,0,1,1]]\n**Output:** [[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],[1,0],[1,1]]\n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `n == grid.length == grid[i].length`\n* `n == 2^x` where `0 <= x <= 6`\n\n\n",

An example of one system is represented in the following picture:\n\n\n![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/28/mdir.jpg)\n\n\nHere, we have `dir` as the only directory in the root. `dir` contains two subdirectories, `subdir1` and `subdir2`. `subdir1` contains a file `file1.ext` and subdirectory `subsubdir1`. `subdir2` contains a subdirectory `subsubdir2`, which contains a file `file2.ext`.\n\n\nIn text form, it looks like this (with \u27f6 representing the tab character):\n\n\n\n```\n\ndir\n\u27f6 subdir1\n\u27f6 \u27f6 file1.ext\n\u27f6 \u27f6 subsubdir1\n\u27f6 subdir2\n\u27f6 \u27f6 subsubdir2\n\u27f6 \u27f6 \u27f6 file2.ext\n\n```\n\nIf we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this: `\"dir\\n\\tsubdir1\\n\\t\\tfile1.ext\\n\\t\\tsubsubdir1\\n\\tsubdir2\\n\\t\\tsubsubdir2\\n\\t\\t\\tfile2.ext\"`. Note that the `'\\n'` and `'\\t'` are the new-line and tab characters.\n\n\nEvery file and directory has a unique **absolute path** in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by `'/'s`. Using the above example, the **absolute path** to `file2.ext` is `\"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext\"`. Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces. Each file name is of the form `name.extension`, where `name` and `extension` consist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.\n\n\nGiven a string `input` representing the file system in the explained format, return *the length of the **longest absolute path** to a **file** in the abstracted file system*.

Each cell interacts with its [eight neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):\n\n\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\n\nThe next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.

Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.\n2. Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.\n3. Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.\n4. Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `\"123\" -> 123`, `\"0032\" -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).\n5. If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be clamped to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be clamped to `231 - 1`.\n6.
